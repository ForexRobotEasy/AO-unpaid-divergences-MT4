This code is an example of how the AO Unpaid Divergences MT4 trading robot developed by Forex Robot Easy Team can work. Please note that this code is not an exact copy of the original product, but rather an approximation based on the original product description.

## Product Description

The AO Unpaid Divergences MT4 is a trading robot that identifies and takes advantage of divergences in the market. Divergences occur when the price of an asset and an indicator move in opposite directions, signaling a potential reversal in the market.

This trading robot uses the Awesome Oscillator (AO) indicator to detect divergences. It calculates the difference between two moving averages (fastMA and slowMA) and compares it to a signal line (signalMA). If a divergence is detected, the robot looks for possible reversal swings (reversalSwingPeriod) to confirm the potential trading opportunity.

The key input parameters for the operation of this product are:

- fastMA: The period for the fast moving average.
- slowMA: The period for the slow moving average.
- signalMA: The period for the signal moving average.
- reversalSwingPeriod: The period for identifying reversal swings.
- divergenceThreshold: The threshold for considering a divergence significant.

When a potential trading opportunity is detected, the robot generates alerts and notifications to notify the user.

Please note that this code is provided as an example and does not guarantee profitable trades. The actual trading robot can be found on the Forex Robot Easy website and on the MQL5 website, where the official version is developed and published.
